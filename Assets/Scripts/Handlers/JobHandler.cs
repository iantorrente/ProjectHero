    Create jobs based on crimes (victims of violent crimes/10
    and victims of proprety crimes/100)

    Should also have jobs based on private/domestic/corporate
    needs, as well as internal hero jobs, like (fight villain, 
    do hero job x, or fight against global disasters)

    Will most likely take generic jobs from a JSON file and then
    interpret the fields to be created as jobs
